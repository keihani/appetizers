Title: Machine learning approaches to identify Parkinson's disease using voice signal features
Abstract: <jats:p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurological disorder that leads to a range of motor and cognitive symptoms. A PD diagnosis is difficult since its symptoms are quite similar to those of other disorders, such as normal aging and essential tremor. When people reach 50, visible symptoms such as difficulties walking and communicating begin to emerge. Even though there is no cure for PD, certain medications can relieve some of the symptoms. Patients can maintain their lifestyles by controlling the complications caused by the disease. At this point, it is essential to detect this disease and prevent it from progressing. The diagnosis of the disease has been the subject of much research. In our project, we aim to detect PD using different types of Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to differentiate between healthy and PD patients by voice signal features. The dataset taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository consisted of 195 voice recordings of examinations carried out on 31 patients. Moreover, our models were trained using different techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Feature Selection, and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to enhance their performance. At the end, we found that MLP and SVM with a ratio of 70:30 train/test split using GridSearchCV with SMOTE gave the best results for our project. MLP performed with an overall accuracy of 98.31%, an overall recall of 98%, an overall precision of 100%, and f1-score of 99%. In addition, SVM performed with an overall accuracy of 95%, an overall recall of 96%, an overall precision of 98%, and f1-score of 97%. The experimental results of this research imply that the proposed method can be used to reliably predict PD and can be easily incorporated into healthcare for diagnosis purposes.</jats:p>

Title: Classification of Parkinson’s disease and its stages using machine learning
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As digital health technology becomes more pervasive, machine learning (ML) provides a robust way to analyze and interpret the myriad of collected features. The purpose of this preliminary work was to use ML classification to assess the benefits and relevance of neurocognitive features both tablet-based assessments and self-reported metrics, as they relate to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and its stages [Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) Stages 1–5]. Further, this work aims to compare perceived versus sensor-based neurocognitive abilities.

For classification between diagnosed and control populations, 17 motor (e.g., device magnitude of acceleration), 9 accuracy (e.g., number of correct/incorrect interactions), and 8 timing features (e.g., time to between interactions) were significant. For classification between early (H&amp;Y Stages 1 and 2) and advanced (H&amp;Y Stages 3, 4, and 5) stages of PD, 7 motor, 12 accuracy, and 14 timing features were significant. Finally, this work depicts that perceived functionality of individuals with PD differed from sensor-based functionalities. In early-stage PD was shown to be <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$21.6\%$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

However, individuals in advanced stages had elevated perceptions (1.57<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>) for executive and behavioral functions compared to early-stage populations. Machine learning in digital health systems allows for a more comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and their stages and may also depict new features that influence the ways digital health technology should be configured.</jats:p>

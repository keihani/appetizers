Title: Machine learning approaches to identify Parkinson's disease using voice signal features
Abstract: <jats:p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurological disorder that leads to a range of motor and cognitive symptoms. A PD diagnosis is difficult since its symptoms are quite similar to those of other disorders, such as normal aging and essential tremor. When people reach 50, visible symptoms such as difficulties walking and communicating begin to emerge. Even though there is no cure for PD, certain medications can relieve some of the symptoms. Patients can maintain their lifestyles by controlling the complications caused by the disease. At this point, it is essential to detect this disease and prevent it from progressing. The diagnosis of the disease has been the subject of much research. In our project, we aim to detect PD using different types of Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to differentiate between healthy and PD patients by voice signal features. The dataset taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository consisted of 195 voice recordings of examinations carried out on 31 patients. Moreover, our models were trained using different techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Feature Selection, and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to enhance their performance. At the end, we found that MLP and SVM with a ratio of 70:30 train/test split using GridSearchCV with SMOTE gave the best results for our project. MLP performed with an overall accuracy of 98.31%, an overall recall of 98%, an overall precision of 100%, and f1-score of 99%. In addition, SVM performed with an overall accuracy of 95%, an overall recall of 96%, an overall precision of 98%, and f1-score of 97%. The experimental results of this research imply that the proposed method can be used to reliably predict PD and can be easily incorporated into healthcare for diagnosis purposes.</jats:p>

Title: Detection of Parkinson’s disease from EEG signals using discrete wavelet transform, different entropy measures, and machine learning techniques
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Early detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is very important in clinical diagnosis for preventing disease development. In this study, we present efficient discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based methods for detecting PD from health control (HC) in two cases, namely, off-and on-medication. First, the EEG signals are preprocessed to remove major artifacts before being decomposed into several EEG sub-bands (approximate and details) using DWT. The features are then extracted from the wavelet packet-derived reconstructed signals using different entropy measures, namely, log energy entropy, Shannon entropy, threshold entropy, sure entropy, and norm entropy. Several machine learning techniques are investigated to classify the resulting PD/HC features. The effects of DWT coefficients and brain regions on classification accuracy are being investigated as well. Two public datasets are used to verify the proposed methods: the SanDiego dataset (31 subjects, 93 min) and the UNM dataset (54 subjects, 54 min). The results are promising and show that four entropy measures: log energy entropy, threshold entropy, sure entropy, and modified-Shannon entropy (TShEn) lead to high classification accuracy, indicating they are good biomarkers for PD detection. With the SanDiego dataset, the classification results of off-medication PD versus HC are 99.89, 99.87, and 99.91 for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, using the combination of DWT + TShEn and KNN classifier. Using the same combination, the results of on-medication PD versus HC are 94.21, 93.33, and 95%. With the UNM dataset, the obtained classification accuracy is around 99.5% in both cases of off-and on-medication PD using DWT + TShEn + SVM and DWT + ThEn + KNN, respectively. The results also demonstrate the importance of all DWT coefficients and that selecting a suitable small number of EEG channels from several brain regions could improve the classification accuracy.</jats:p>
